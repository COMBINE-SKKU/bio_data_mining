- Week02: General Linear Model example (design matrix and contrast)
- Week03: Prediction Framework
- Week04: Peformance evaluation (sensitivity-specificty, Precision-Recall, F1), Regularized regression and feature selection (Functional connectivity)
- Week05: Full lectures without code implementation (supervised learning methods)
- Week06: Ensemble Methods - AdaBoost and Gradient Boosting
- Week07: Dimensionality Reduction - Principal Component Analysis, Eigenface example
- Week08: Full lectures without code implementation (PLS and CCA)
