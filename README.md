# Bio Data Mining
This is a set of hand-on session codes for the online course 'Bio Data Mining' opened in the SKKU (GBE3071_41). 
The codes will be uploaded here every Monday. Please feel free to fork or clone the codes and learn yourself. 

- Week01: Simple Linear Regression
- Week02: General Linear Model example (design matrix and contrast)
- Week03: Prediction Framework
- Week04: Peformance evaluation (sensitivity-specificty, Precision-Recall, F1), Regularized regression and feature selection (Functional connectivity)
- Week05: Full lectures without code implementation (supervised learning methods)
- Week06: Ensemble Methods - AdaBoost and Gradient Boosting
- Week07: Dimensionality Reduction - Principal Component Analysis, Eigenface example
- Week08: Full lectures without code implementation (PLS and CCA)
- Week09: Full lectures without code implementation (Clustering)
- Week10: Clustering analysis (Partitioning, Hierarchical clustering)
- Week11: Factor analysis (adequacy test, factor extration, rotation)
